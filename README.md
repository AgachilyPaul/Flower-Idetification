# Flower-Idetification
## Details:
Comprehensive Course Design I required participated students to design complicated software. So together with another two students, we designed this system to identify flowers using deep learning. In the front end, we designed a web using Javascript & Bootstrap to enable users to upload pictures that need to be identified and provide landing, registering and discussing functions. The uploaded pictures will be sent to backstage using https. In the backstage, pictures were distinguished and the 
s would be sent back to the front end. The backstage was designed using Python and Flask. As for the identification algorithm, we decided to use CNN because it was an advanced method to solve CV issues. Since there are many sorts of CNN, we compared the performance of GoogleNet, VGG, BN-Inception, Inception-v3, Inception-2, and finally decided on Inception-v3. We used two methods to accelerate the computation. The first one was conducting dimension reduction before aggregation and decomposing the convolution of the large filter into several small filter convolution. The second one was using the convolution kernel of 1*3 and 3*1 instead of using the 3*3 convolution kernel. We use MySql for data saving and gathered the data for training using a spider
